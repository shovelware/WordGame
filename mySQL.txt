###create user and give permissions (as root)
CREATE USER "wguser" IDENTIFIED BY "wgpass";
GRANT ALL ON wordgame.* TO "wguser" IDENTIFIED BY "wgpass";

###create both tables
create table hiscore(
	hiscore_id INT NOT NULL PRIMARY KEY AUTO_INCREMENT,
	score_amt INT NOT NULL,
	player_sn varchar(16) NOT NULL
);

create table dict(
	dict_id INT NOT NULL PRIMARY KEY AUTO_INCREMENT,
	word_sn VARCHAR(24)
);

###insert words
INSERT INTO dict(word_sn) VALUES("word");

###insert score
INSERT INTO hiscore(player_sn, score_amt) VALUES("name", score);

###check guess is in dictionary (will be empty if not)
SELECT * from dict where word_sn = "guess";

###get highest id in dictionary
select max(dict_id) from dict;

##Select random source word?
SELECT * 
	FROM dict 
	WHERE CHAR_LENGTH(word_sn) >= 7 
ORDER BY RAND() 
LIMIT 1;

###select top 10 scorers
SELECT player_sn, score_amt
    FROM hiscore
ORDER BY score_amt DESC, hiscore_id ASC
LIMIT 10;

###NON-SQL but longest word in file
