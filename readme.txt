Hi there!

This work is uploaded in the state I demonstrated it for college, and as such some unforeseen bugs and crashes may occur. Feel free to peruse the code at your leisure. It may not be the best, but it's mine, and that's all I can offer.

I can be reached at http://github.com/shovelware , which is presumably where this code was downloaded. Any questions, comments or other things can be forwarded over there and I'll respond in as timely manner as I can.
