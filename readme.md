Hi there!

This work is uploaded in the state I demonstrated it for college, and as such some unforeseen bugs and crashes may occur. Feel free to peruse the code at your leisure. It may not be the best, but it's mine, and that's all I can offer.

I can be reached at http://github.com/shovelware , which is presumably where this code was downloaded. Any questions, comments or other things can be forwarded over there and I'll respond in as timely manner as I can.

This code's relative is live at  http://c001533.pythonanywhere.com/ , where you can play the game and even place on the leaderboard! This is the original branch, which features words parsed from a text file. The master branch features SQL database integration and some other additions, and is the closer version to what's currently live.
